mif2xml - Convert MIF files to XML 
===============================================================================

ABOUT 

mif2xml is a tool which reads in MIF (Maker Interchange Format) files produced
from FrameMaker and converts them to XML. The XML attempts to be very similar
to the original MIF. Input is read from stdin and XML is written to stdout.

Example usage:

    $ mif2xml < file.mif > output.xml

BUILDING

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install
